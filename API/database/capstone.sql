Nose of cracker, light breaded malts, and honey sweet malts with a touch of pear and grape notes. Flavors follow the nose with honey touched malts with breaded malts and a touch of dry cracker with some pear crispness amongst a touch of herbal hops.

(1, 1002, 3.9, 'Very traditional Belgian-style wheat with a great flavor profile. Good balance of clove and banana yeasty flavors. Well balanced overall, not too sweet. Well crafted!'),
(1, 1003, 4.5, 'Oooooowoooooooo hops. Holy cow. This checks all the boxes in what I expect from an IPA. Wowee. Bitterness and aftertaste hit you after. Good stuff. Yep.'),
(1, 1004, 4.9, 'Flavorful and refreshing, a long-time favorite summer beer for me. A year round fav, actually. Clear golden color, low to moderate carbonation, nice head dissolves pretty quickly, pleasing lacing, not too much. Moderately alchoholic, high fives. All in all, a superb, restrained brew, that doesn''t cry out for attention. But you realize that it deserves attention: perfect balance of malt and hops, (for a lager, that is). To me, the equal of some of the most enjoyable lagers I''ve had in Germany.'),
(1, 1005, 4.7, 'Deep syrupy smell with a hint of coffee and chocolate and licorice. I like carbonation and this delivers, every sip is accompanied with a crisp punch. Before I evaluate the flavors I experience the carbonation and I like that. Pours nicely into a glass. Dark body with creamy head and smoky flavor. I''m honestly surprised this is best in style bc I just picked it up randomly. FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD. This is a good beer, drink and be well.'),
(1, 1008, 4.0, 'A couple of 12 oz. cans fit into a clear glass liter mug, since the head, though tight and durable, didn''t overextend its welcome. Its color is a dense and dark orange-amber. The nose picks up a little hoppiness, but not in abundance and not much more. The glass lacing is minimal. There''s very little sweetness to the introduction, despite a decent amount of malts to the tongue. Self described as a NEIPA, that''s how it will be rated here. Unlike most in the category, there''s very little starchy contributions that compliment or take the edge off a hoppy and relatively high ABV brew. There is more alcohol in the finish than good NEIPAs that provide more proof than a 6.7% ABV. This is a far better than bad beer. It took Great Lakes a while to add to the list of hazy beers. They could have done better.'),
(1, 1006, 4.6, '16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 10/27/2017. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper, pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper, pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 6.8%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very Midwest feeling style. Big juicy and fairly dank hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with adequate lingering dryness. A very enjoyable offering.'),
(1, 1007, 3.7, '16 FL OZ can, served in an oversized, stemless, wine glass. This beer pours like pineapple juice. It is topped with two inches of off white head that leaves spotty lacing. The smell is loaded with tropical fruit with hints of pine. It starts out with tropical fruit flavor. The finish is pine. That pine grows with each sip leaving an increasingly bitter taste in my mouth. Medium to full mouthfeel. This is a pretty good beer. It marries the fruit juice NEIPA with the bitter finish of a west coast IPA. Which may be how to style is supposed to taste. I''m just so used to the fruit juice bombs that Hoof releases every two weeks.'),
(1, 1009, 3.8, 'Bought in Ohio at a Trader Joe’s.
I love how all the grains and hops are listed on the side of the can.
Look is a nice bright yellow.
Smell is floral with the hops also present.
Taste is a bit bitter, but not too bad.
Feel is nice, a bit biting but refreshing.
Overall it’s not too shabby.'),
